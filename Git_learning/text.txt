hello its nice to see you are looking in my repo.


here you cd to the folder where this file is present then
  
  1. make some changes in this file or delete whats written and save it.

  2. And now you may use 
        git diff text.txt 
   This command will let you know the changes you have made after the previous commit.    

  3. Then type
         git checkout text.txt 
    This command will make the changes revert back or roll back   to the last commit you have made meaning you will see all this again.
